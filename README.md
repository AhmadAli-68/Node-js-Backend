# üîπMiddlewares

 Humary pas bny bnaye middlewares bhi milty hain, jinko hum .use method se kaam me la skty hain.

```JavaScript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    your code...
    next()
})
```
---
For example, hum chahty hain k logged in user admin hona chahiye... to hum aik middleware code likh skty hain jo check kre ga k user admin hai ya nai. jaisy hi user k credentials match ho jayn gy to yeh apne ap next pr move nai kre ga... hume is k liye **next()** function use krna hoga, like in the above code.

---
__*Note: hum is next() method k andr information bhi pass kr skty hain, brackets k andr*__

__*Note: Position matters in creating middlewares, always keep the middlewares above the routes*__

## üëâüèª Built-in Middlewares

```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))
```

1. app.use(...)
    - This registers middleware in your Express app.
    - Middleware runs before your route handlers and is often used to process request data.

2. express.urlencoded(...)
    - This is a built-in Express middleware that parses incoming requests with application/x-www-form-urlencoded payloads (the format used by HTML form submissions by default).
    - It converts the form data into a JavaScript object and attaches it to req.body.

3. { extended: false }
    - This option controls which library is used to parse the data.
    - extended: false ‚Üí Uses the Node.js built-in querystring library (simple, can only parse strings and arrays).
    - extended: true ‚Üí Uses the qs library (more powerful, supports nested objects).

### Example:

```javascript
username = ahmad,
age = 22
```
then after this middleware

```javascript
req.body = { username: "ahmad", age: "22" }
```

---

```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'ejs')
```

- This line tells Express which template engine to use for rendering views.
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating language that lets you write HTML pages with embedded JavaScript.
- With this setting:
    - You don‚Äôt need to write .ejs every time in res.render().
    - Express automatically looks for .ejs files in the views/ directory by default.

---

```javascript
app.use(express.json())
```
- This middleware tells Express to automatically parse JSON request bodies.
- It is typically used when building APIs or when clients (like Postman, React, Angular, or mobile apps) send JSON data.
- After this middleware, JSON data becomes available on req.body.

## üëâüèª Types of middlewares:

- Application Level Middlewares
- Router Level Middlewares
- Error handling Middlewares
- Built in Middlewares
- Third Party Middlewares - like npm packages

# üîπImplement Form Validation

Form validations are used to prevent the users to enter the wrong information. So, to prevent that, the package *"express-validator"* is used. 

```javascript
npm i express-validator

import { body, validationResult } from 'express-validator'

let validationRegistration = [
    body('username').notEmpty().withMessage('Username is required.'),
    body('password').isLength({min: 6, max: 10}).withMessage('Password must be must be 5 to 10 characters long.')
]
```
---
Isko hum middleware k tor pr use krain gy, like in the below:

```javascript
app.post('/save-form', validationRegistration, (req, res) => {
    const result = validationResult(req)
    res.send(result)
})
```
---
## üëâüèª Validation Methods

- notEmpty()
- isEmail()
- isLength(options)
- isNumeric()
- isAlpha()
- isAlphanumeric()
- isURL()
- isDate()
- isln()
- isStrongPassword()
- isUpperCase()
- isLowerCase()
- matches(pattern)
---
## üëâüèª Sanitization Methods

- trim()
- Itrim()
- rtrim()
- escape()
- unescape()
- normalizeEmail()
- tolnt()
- toFloat()
- toBoolean()
---
## üëâüèª Custom Validations

- custom(validator)
- customSanitizer(sanitizer)

# üîπFile Upload with Multer

- __Multer__
    1. Storage
        - Destination
        - Filename (suggestion: don't save file with same name)
    2. Limits
        - fileSize (bytes)
        - files (can also apply limits for how many files can be upload)
        - fields (we can set fields for multiple fields, e.g., one for image and one for resume)
        - fieldNameSize (we can specify the size of the fields.)
    3. File Filter (Optional)
        - Image (PNG, JPEG)
        - PDF
        - Excel
        - Word
        - Video

## üëâüèª Getting Started with Multer

```javascript
npm install multer
```

```javascript
import multer from 'multer'
```

```javascript
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function(req, res, cb) {
        cb(null, './uploads') // cb means callback
        // cb contains two parameters: one for error and one for folder
        // null means, it contains no error
    },

    filename: function(req, file, cb) {
        const newFileName = Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname)
        cb(null, newFileName)

        // here path.extname is from package called 'path', we have to import it on top. It is used to extract the extension of the file being uploaded.
    }
})
```

```javascript
const limits = {
    fileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 5 // 5 MB of file size
    // 1KB = 1024 Bytes
}
```

```javascript
const upload = multer({
    storage: storage,
    limits: limits
})
```

```javascript
// We will use it as a middleware in our routes

app.post('/submitForm', upload.single('imageFile'), (req, res) => {
    res.send(req.file)

    // here single means, we can select a single image of file.
})
```

```javascript
// For multiple files:

upload.array('imageFile', 5) // which means, user can upload max 5 images/files. 

// for multiple fields, for example, one pic + documents,

upload.fields([
    {
        name: 'profilePic',
        maxCount: 1
    },
    {
        name: 'documents',
        maxCount: 3
    }
])

// Here we will upload files in the form of array of objects.
```

# üîπExpress JS: Session

Let's suppose, the some user want to save the data on your website.

Data hum 2 trha se save kr skty hain
- Aik permanent data save krna (means in MongoDB or mySQL)
- Aur dusra temporary data save krna, jo k aik time k baad apne ap delete jo jaye ga, ya hum us specific time se pehle khud bhi delete kr skty hain.
    - Isi ko hum Express.js me __Sessions__ (save temporary info on the server) bolty hain.

---

## üëâüèª Examples:

- User Authentications
- Shopping Cart
- Flash Messages (Show message from one page to another page)
- Multi-Step Form
- User Preferences
    - we have seen many websites where we can change the language of the website so that info save in the sessions.
- Form Data Preservation
    - Sessions ki waja se jb bhi page refresh hoga, form data will not be lost.
- CAPTCHA Verification

---

## üëâüèª Getting Started with Express.js Sessions

```javascript
npm install express-session
```

```javascript
import session from 'express-session'
```

```javascript
// We will use sessions as middlewares.
// we will provide 4 keys as an object

app.use(session({
    secret: 'mySecretKey' // secret means any password or secret key

    resave: false // means we will never do any kind of modification. In 99% cases, we never modify the session info, if you want to modify it, you can set it to true.

    saveUninitialized: false // means don't create the session unless the user save the information in the session.

    cookie: { maxAge: 86400000 } // in the cookie, we set, after how much time the session will get deleted. and we pass the data in the form of object. (86400000 = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
}))
```

---

### Store Session

```javascript
req.session.key = 'value';
```

### Read Session

```javascript
res.send(req.session.key)
```

### Delete Session

```javascript
req.session.destroy()
```
